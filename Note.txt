1.Tracking the first project!!
git iignore --->create a gitignore file and add the names of the files that we wont to ignore
a.touch .gitignore
b.include the file name in the text file that you have with extension .ignore
c.save that file
and proceed with your regulary stuff happily
your file /folders name in the  . wont be tracked

2. Use git add  .to track all files
the files appearing in green represents they are in staging area
3.git commit -m "message" to make a commit in the repo

4.to see which files are there in the staging area we have command git ls -files

5 to remove any file from the staging area use the command git rm --cached filename
6.To look at commits
git log
 Head -->master(points to the commit in repo which you have in your working directory :::
 by default it points to the latest commit )
 7. git diff shows us the difference in the files in "staging area" and the "working directory"
 8. git diff --staged show the difference in the files in "staging area" and the  "repo"

 git restore filename --> to restore a file from your staging area

 Connecting to github
 1.Establish a link  --> git remote add origin "url"
 2.name the branch --> git branch -M main we have to run these commands
 only once in start to connect to the repo aafter thatwe do not need them
 3.git remote -v -->to check the adress of remote to which your local is connected
 4.git remote remove origin --> to remove the already established connection
 ---------------------------zip download-------------------------
 download the code (from the latest commit )that is there in the github
 ------------------------------Git clone------------------------------
Will download the whole repository so that everyone has the same exact history
while working on the project open your terminal at the point to clone command
get  "url"
